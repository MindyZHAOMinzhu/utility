# AutoHotkey 

AHK is an awesome tool to customize your windows. 
It provides simple scripting abilities. 

I majorly use it due to one incompatibility problem 
between Firefox and its plugin Vimperrator. 
When you focus on page elements like Flash player, 
Vimperrator looses effect. 
So I use AHK to bind a hotkey that can unfocus firefox. 

This problem was fixed about two years ago I think. 
Besides, I do not work on windows for a long time. 
The script is here for those who have interest.
